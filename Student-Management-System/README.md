### Project Overview

 This project uses Dictionary and Lists to manage the marks of the students in various different subjects.


### Learnings from the project

 I learnt how to use lists and dictionary and all its operations to perform various different tasks.


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 I created a list of all students and a dictionary to store the Math marks of each student and then found who got the highest marks by using the max function.


### Challenges faced

 I faced problems to understand how to use the max function on a dictionary as max function is only used for lists.
I overcome that by reading the Python documentation.
