### Project Overview

 This project reads the file data and parses the data of the file to create a secret message which is then written in a file.


### Learnings from the project

 I learnt how to manipulate with the file data and parse the strings to handle data.


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 I created a function to read the file data by passing the file path. After that i stored the data and parsed the data using multiple different functions.
Once it was done, the final secret data is written in a file.


### Challenges faced

 I didn't face any problems except for data type conversion which i was able to solve using the hints given by the problems.
