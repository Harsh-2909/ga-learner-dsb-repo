### Project Overview

 This is a Python Project made using Numpy which is used to make sense of Census data.


### Learnings from the project

 After completing this project, I have learned on how to manipulate CSV data in Python 3 using Numpy. We can filter, find, calculate the data from the csv file and make sense of the data for some powerful insights.


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 I used Numpy functions and vectorization whenever it was required. I read the csv data first and then based on the insights, I found different things about data.


### Challenges faced

 I faced some challenges optimising and refactoring the code. For that, I took reference with Numpy documentation and GreyAtom previous lessons to do it in the most optimal way as I can.
