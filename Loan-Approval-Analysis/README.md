### Project Overview

 This project uses Python3 to do Data Analysis using numpy and pandas module. It uses those modules to do Data Analysis on a Loan Approval Dataset to get some proper insights from the data. 


### Learnings from the project

 I learned how to use pandas module properly to analyse and get important insights from a given dataset. I also learned how to fill in NaN (Missing Values) in the dataset and modify the dataset properly.


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 I used various pandas methods to modify data and find different statistical data like mean, median to get the insights that we needed for this Data Analysis.


### Challenges faced

 I faced quite a lot of challenges to realise where to use which pandas method as there is a vast variety of pandas method which can be used. I also took a lot of help from the pandas documentation to find what to do with a given method.
